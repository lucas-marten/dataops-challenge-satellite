### **Summary**  

This project focused on processing and analyzing satellite data to extract meaningful meteorological insights. The workflow involved handling large geospatial datasets, performing reprojection and merging operations, and generating visualizations to aid interpretation.  

#### **Key Observations**  
- **Cloud and Weather Systems:** High-altitude clouds, such as cumulonimbus, were detected in tropical convection zones, while extratropical cyclones displayed vortex-like structures. The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) was visible in the Southern Hemisphere, with cloud discontinuities over the Atlantic Ocean likely associated with the South Atlantic Subtropical High.  
- **Water Vapor Distribution:** Moisture vortices were observed in the mid-troposphere, particularly in South America, indicating complex atmospheric circulation patterns.  
- **Surface Features:** High reflectivity in desert regions contrasted with darker forested areas, showing the impact of land cover on satellite imagery.  

#### **Challenges Encountered**  
- **Handling Large Datasets:** Processing high-resolution satellite images required optimized techniques to manage memory and computational resources effectively.  
- **GDAL Installation and Compatibility:** Ensuring proper installation and configuration of GDAL for both system and Python environments was a significant hurdle.  
- **Data Projection and Merging:** Aligning different satellite bands with varying resolutions and projections while preserving atmospheric continuity posed a technical challenge.  
- **Feature Interpretation:** Differentiating cloud types and analyzing atmospheric moisture required an understanding of meteorological patterns.  

#### **Results Achieved**  
- Successfully processed and reprojected satellite images into a common coordinate system (EPSG:4326).  
- Merged visible and water vapor bands to provide a comprehensive meteorological analysis.  
- Extracted cloud and moisture patterns that highlight significant weather features, such as convective systems and circulation dynamics.  

This project demonstrated the feasibility of satellite data processing for meteorological insights, with potential applications in weather monitoring and forecasting.
